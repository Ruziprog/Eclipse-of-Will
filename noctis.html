            <h2 class="section-title">Political Structure</h2>
            <p>The Empire is not merely a state, but a system of deifying power. At its head stands the Noctis Dynasty, seen by the people as embodied avatars of the Law. Their power is sacred, supported by the Imperon - a will that permeates reality.</p>

            <div class="quote">"Be strong or disappear."</div>
            <p>This is not just a slogan - it's a metaphysical law. Weakness is viewed not as a flaw, but as a sin against nature. All values are subordinated to the principle <span class="highlight">Potentia Est Ius</span> - power determines morality, law, and the meaning of existence.</p>

    <h2 class="section-title">The Noctis Dynasty: A Family Portrait in Shadow</h2>
    <div class="royalfamily-grid">
        <!-- King Rhein Noctis -->
        <div class="royalfamily-card">
            <a href="rein.html">
                <div class="royalfamily-name">King Rhein Noctis</div>
            </a>
            <p class="latin-name">Rhein Noctis - "The Unwavering Pillar" (Stator Invictus)</p>
            <p><span class="highlight">Meaning of Name:</span> From the ancient word meaning "river" or "flow", but in the context of Noctis it is "The Flow of Necessity".</p>
            <p><span class="highlight">Character:</span> Outwardly - the ideal imperial ruler: icy, emotionless, calculating. His decisions seem inhumane because they are subordinated to a higher, impersonal logic of survival. Inwardly - a broken man and father. Every act of "cruelty" towards Freia burns away part of his soul.</p>
            <p><span class="highlight">Power:</span> Embodiment of the Kratos Principle (Power-Through-Pain). His true skill is seeing potential in pain and ruthlessly realizing it.</p>
            <p><span class="highlight">Age:</span> 40</p>
            <p><span class="highlight">Height:</span> 190cm</p>

            <div class="royalfamily-name">Queen Amilla Noctis</div>
            <p class="latin-name">Amilla Noctis - "The Iron Rose" (Rosa Ferrea)</p>
            <p><span class="highlight">Meaning of Name:</span> Derived from the ancient word for "keeper" or "protector".</p>
            <p><span class="highlight">Character:</span> If Rhein is the cold reason of the system, then Amilla is its wounded heart. She is more emotional and therefore suffers more visibly. Her compassion is a constant, quiet civil war with herself.</p>
            <p><span class="highlight">Power:</span> Channel of the Nike Melainē Principle (Black Victory). She is a master of total, final suppression, ensuring not just victory but the erasure of all memory of resistance.</p>
            <p><span class="highlight">Age:</span> 40</p>
            <p><span class="highlight">Height:</span> 185cm</p>

            <p><span class="highlight">Role:</span> Princess and sole surviving heir of Imperium Noctis.</p>
            <p><span class="highlight">Character:</span> Product of brutal "engineering" to remove humanity. Cynical, aromantic, with deep psychological scars. Only vulnerable to cats.</p>
            <p><span class="highlight">Power:</span> Eidolon-Evolution - turns scars into weapons. Wields Evocatio Ensis and unique battle abilities.</p>
            <p><span class="highlight">Age:</span> 16</p>

            <p><span class="highlight">Name Origin:</span> Roman goddess of war, sister of Mars. A name full of strength and valor given to a child they wanted to see as a strong and just leader.</p>
            <p><span class="highlight">Character (in life):</span> By her parents' memories - a bright, curious, kind girl who inherited their original idealism. She could have become a bridge between worlds.</p>

                <p><span class="highlight">Heritage & "Second Daughter":</span></p>
                <p>At age 9, she dreamed of a little brother or sister, collecting pretty stones with her commoner friends to make a bracelet as a gift.</p>
                <p>She was killed by marauders while visiting a friend's birthday shortly after her coronation.</p>
                <p>Her unquiet soul, full of resentment and fear, made a deal with the Principles and entered the newborn Freia. Thus, Freia has been a "vessel" for her older sister since birth.</p>
