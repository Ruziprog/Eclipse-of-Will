    <div class="chapter" id="prologue">
        <h2 class="chapter-title">PROLOGUE: DYNASTY IN THE SHADOW OF SUPREME PRINCIPLES</h2>
        <p>Freia Noctis — the only surviving daughter and heir of King Rein and Queen Amilla, rulers of Imperium Noctis, a civilization that elevated the law of power to the absolute. But behind their cruelty lies an abyss of personal tragedy: they were hostages to the Supreme Principles — metaphysical forces that prescribed them to ensure reality's survival at the cost of their daughter's soul. They wore masks of heartless tyrants to hide their despair.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="chapter" id="childhood">
        <h2 class="chapter-title">CHILDHOOD: ENGINEERING OF HELL (AGE 0-9)</h2>
        <p>Her upbringing was not training, but surgical removal of humanity, conducted with the silent consent of the Principles.</p>
        
        <div class="timeline-item">
            <span class="age-label">0-3 Years</span>
            <span>Strict, militarized care. Her first "toys" were replicas of torture instruments.</span>

        <div class="timeline-item">
            <span class="age-label">3-6 Years</span>

    </div>

    <div class="chapter" id="light">
        <h2 class="chapter-title">THE ONLY LIGHT THEY ALLOWED THEMSELVES TO GIVE</h2>
        <p>During this time, she gained her only friend — Rudzi, a teenage butler from Imperium Lumen. He secretly showed her kindness, becoming living proof that compassion exists. Her parents saw this, and their souls were torn by internal struggle. They saw her smile for the first time, and part of them yearned to leave everything as it was. But the dictate of the Principles and the memory of their eldest daughter, Bellona, who died due to "weakness", were relentless. Rudzi disappeared — not killed, but exiled through a portal, becoming an eternal, unhealing wound in her heart.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="chapter" id="eebirth">
        <h2 class="chapter-title">EIDOLON EVOLUTION: BIRTH OF THE WEAPON</h2>
        <p>At age 10, in the final tournament, on the brink of death from the strongest opponent, her veins ignited with purple radiance, and her bones restructured in sync with agony. She acquired Eidolon Evolution — power purchased at the price of all her previous pain, and killed her opponent. For her parents, this was a bitter triumph — their method "worked".</p>
    </div>

    <div class="chapter" id="war">
        <h2 class="chapter-title">WAR: TEMPERING OF STEEL (AGE 10-15)</h2>
        <p>She was sent to the front of the Five-Year War. She became an instrument of genocide, unaware that in one of the raids, her hand killed Rudzi's mother. Prince Lumen III, who loved her and believed in peace, fell by her blade during his confession. Each killing was for her parents another nail in the coffin of their own humanity, but they saw in it the final, harshest lesson of survival.</p>

        <p>When the cup of suffering overflows, and pain threatens to dissolve the last boundaries of consciousness, the Heir of Darkness is born — the absolute monarch of pain, imprisoned in the darkest crypts of Freia's soul. This is the Unrested soul of Freia's dead sister named Bellona, who was killed by marauders and should have been the future ruler. Her sister became her vessel from birth.</p>

            <p>Each activation of the Heir of Darkness is a step toward oblivion. After the fifth manifestation, Freia's personality will be irreversibly absorbed, and her body will become an eternal vessel for this cold, arrogant queen. Her mind, her "palace," will fall, and only a perfect weapon will remain in the world, devoid of the last traces of that girl who once loved kittens.</p>

        <p>Freia — a princess in flight, a recluse anti-hero. Her goal is not to save worlds, but to find absolute peace, torn between escaping her parents' legacy and searching for the last grains of humanity in memories of Rudzi and the silent affection of cats.</p>
