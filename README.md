# Eclipse of Will - Fantasy Universe

 **Work in Progress** 
My personal fantasy world project — currently under development.

##  The Story So Far
This is the beginning of a larger universe. Right now you'll find:
- Basic website structure with two empires
- Go backend APIs in early stages
- Foundation for future expansion

## Current Status
  **Done:**
- Website homepage with empire selection
- Basic Go APIs for anime and characters
- Project structure setup

  **In Progress:**
- More pages for each empire
- Character battle system improvements
- Database integration

  **Planned:**
- Full storyline implementation
- User authentication
- Interactive maps
- Mobile app version

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- **Backend:** Go (Golang)
- **Tools:** Git, GitHub

## Philosophy
This project grows organically — I build features as I learn new technologies.  
It's not perfect, but it's real and evolving.

## For Visitors
Feel free to explore the code, suggest ideas, or fork your own version.  
Every great universe starts with a single line of code.
